# Stock Market LSTM Model

@author Hadi Hamed

This script allows a user to input a stock's ticker. The program reads whichever stock ticker is in the script, then downloads the stock's price data from Alpha Vantage. It then trains an LSTM model on the older data, and outputs a prediction graph for the more recent dates.

### Libraries
- AlphaVantage is the direct API to download stock data
- All other libraries should be available by default
