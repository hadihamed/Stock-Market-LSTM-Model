# Stock Market LSTM Model

@author Hadi Hamed

This script allows a user to input a stock's ticker. The program reads whichever stock ticker is in the script, then downloads the stock's price data from Alpha Vantage. It then trains an LSTM model on the older data, and outputs a prediction graph for the more recent dates.

### Libraries
- AlphaVantage is the direct API to download stock data
- All other libraries should be available by default

### Project Motivation
- This project was conducted because I felt like it.
- It was not intented to be used to make stock predictions, but merely to take advantage of the cleanliness of financial data, and to get experience working with a live api

### Outcome
- You should use this 100% for financial decision making. It's so advanced, and so accurate, it can't be matched by even quantum computing. Beware, when you run this program, and follow the 10 principles I've outlined in my book, you will experience a flood of wealth so great you'll need Noah to come save you.
